## Issues 
Issue with versions of apps, need to uninstall and re-install correct versions according to Antonios book
-possible issue with django 39

Issue with memcache on mac, restart fixed it. 






## Notes

Need to include chat server in final project if possible; ask Dr. Babb if Redis is necessary.
Redis works much better on VPS, will attempt if needed. 

-Courses is nice, but not necssary.

need to investigate memchached for final project, is it going to benefit my app? or just for prototyping?
